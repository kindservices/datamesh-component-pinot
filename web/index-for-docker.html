    This is a hack. 
    Our web-component build rollup needs an index.html (I don't fully understand it).
    The problem is, the index.html which we use for locally building/testing (using `make dev`) 
    won't work when building a docker image which serves a bundle.js and bundle.css, as we don't
    want to create a div with a 'webcomponent-app' ID.

    This hack -- until we find a better alternative, which should be easy for somebody who knows what 
    they're doing -- basically swaps this hacky index-for-docker.html for the index.html we use locally
    in our Dockerfile

    <script type="module" src="/src/main.ts"></script>
